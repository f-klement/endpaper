"""Closed value sets shared by the ORM, the schemas and the query parameters.

These are `StrEnum`, so they compare equal to their string value and store as
plain text in SQLite, so existing rows keep working untouched. The point of
declaring them is what happens downstream: FastAPI emits them into the OpenAPI
schema as enumerations, which is what lets the generated TypeScript client have
union types like `"unread" | "reading" | "read"` instead of `string`.
